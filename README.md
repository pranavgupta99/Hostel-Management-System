# Hostel-Management-System
<br>
As the name specifies “HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” this is a basic software
developed for managing various activities in the hostel. For the past few years the number
of educational institutions are increasing rapidly. Thereby the number of hostels are also
increasing for the accommodation of the students studying in this institution. And hence there is a lot of strain on
the personwho are running the hostel and software’s are not usually used in this context.
This particular project deals with the problems on managing a hostel and avoids the problems
which occur when carried manually.
Identification of the drawbacks of the existing system leads to the designing of
computerized system that will be compatible to the existing system with the system Which is
more user friendly and more GUI oriented.
